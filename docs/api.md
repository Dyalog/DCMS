# API Reference

## Endpoints
GET endpoints are defined in `/src/read_/endpoints.json5`.

Programmatically, endpoint switches are explicit in `#.DCMS.Get` and `#.DCMS.Post`.

- GET /videos
- GET /persons
- GET /presenters
- GET /refresh  
    Update the API data from the database. Requires authentication.
- GET /tables  
    A list of all database tables

The POST endpoints are used by the admin functions. They all require authentication.
- POST /event
- POST /person
- POST /videos

### GET persons
Query parameters:

- id
- organisation

## API functions
These APL functions provide the REST interface.

### read_

#### Query
By default, every table in the database is exposed as an endpoint `http://url_base/table_name`. Any with text columns (text, char or varchar) can also be queried with the `s=` parameter.

The `s=` "search" parameter searches for the presence of all of the words provided. For example, searching "hello world" would return records for which the word "hello" appeared in at least one column and "world" also appeared, even if in a different column. Both words must appear in the record.

Any column can be specifically searched using the `[column_name]=[query]` "column" parameter.

### TODO
if you create a staging branch, then you can pretty much copy the IF statement in the deployment, ideally, we'll probably move the Credentials for that section too so we can run the staging in Bramley rather than in Gosport, change the URL and the name / ID and it will just happen (I need to set the ID up first)
as for the database, it will use the same dockerfile - so either you'd have a staging dockerfile, or persistent data - what you could do is have an admin command on a post so you can do something like curl -X POST -d "CLEARDATABASE" http://dcms.dyalog.bramley/api/v1/admin/commands
that's just an example, but if you have the commands there to do a DROP TABLE.... followed by your migrations, then you're probably in a good spot to reset it when you need to
